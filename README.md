# columbus-ui

This herein lies the code for the front-end of our school information security assignment. It just browses the data that the [backend](https://github.com/project-columbus/backend) feeds it.

## Note
If you have suggestions/ways to help improve my code, I will be super super happy to hear those feedback/suggestions! However, if you're looking for an A+ polished repository with immaculate adoption of modern JavaScript mumbo jumbo you're probably going to be disappointed. Making it an actual product beyond the purposes of our demonstration in school was never our intention.

## What I Use
- Gulp
- Babelify (with Gulp - not sure if I'm doing this right)

1. Install Node/NPM
2. Install gulp with `npm install -g gulp`
